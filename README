## Git-From-Scratch

I work with `git` for like a lot of time and listening to the terms that I don'
t have enough knowledge gives me a hit.

So, here I am, figuring out how git may work. 
It is just a trial where I will try to figure out how `git` `may` work. Since I am not 
interested in reading the original mirror of @git so I though of challenging myself a bit.
